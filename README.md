# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

## Operation

To start the app use: `./start.sh`, it'll start both the backend and the frontend.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/README.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## Troubleshooting
- In case port 3000 is already in use (by Backend for instance):
    - Go to backend dir, run ./start.sh in there.
    - After that go to frontend dir, run ./start.sh in there, select port 3001.
